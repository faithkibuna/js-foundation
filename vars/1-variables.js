/*in variables we have  let, const and var
let- is used to declare variables that can be changed later
const- is used to declare variables that cannot be changed later
var- is used to declare variables but its usage is discouraged in modern javascript because of its function scope
*/

//example of let and const
let age = 25; //this  is a variable declaration without initialization
//age = 23; this is variable initialization
//age = 25; this is variable reassignment
//age = age + 10; this is another way of reassigning a variable

console.log("i am " + age + " years old");
